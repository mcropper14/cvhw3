Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable
Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation

DeepLabv3+, extends
DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the
segmentation results especially along object boundaries

 applies several parallel atrous convolution with different rates

 adds a decoder module to recover object boundaries 


 We propose a novel encoder-decoder structure which employs DeepLabv3 as
a powerful encoder module and a simple yet effective decoder module.
– In our structure, one can arbitrarily control the resolution of extracted encoder features by atrous convolution to trade-off precision and runtime,
which is not possible with existing encoder-decoder models.
– We adapt the Xception model for the segmentation task and apply depthwise
separable convolution to both ASPP module and decoder module, resulting
in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network.
