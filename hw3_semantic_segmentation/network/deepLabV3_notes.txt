atrous convolution, a powerful tool
to explicitly adjust filterâ€™s field-of-view as well as control the
resolution of feature responses computed by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

control teh resoution  where features are computed 

enalarge the fiedl of view of filters for multi scale context 

need contextual info for segmnetation 

context modeule 

spatial pyramid pooling, capture context at several ranges 

control how densely to compute feature responses in fully convolutional networls 

ASPP - one 1x1 convolutional 
 
three 3x3 convs w rates = 6, 12, 18 when output stride = 16 

256 filters, batch norm
